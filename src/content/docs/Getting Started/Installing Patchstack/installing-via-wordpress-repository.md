You are now taken to the Patchstack plugin's setup screen.  
To connect the plugin with Patchstack App, you need to enter your site **API key** into the plugin.

You can find **API key** in the <a href="https://app.patchstack.com" target="_blank"><b>Patchstack App</b></a>, when you navigate to **My Sites > yourdomain.com > Settings**. 

See image below:

That API key needs to be pasted to your WordPress plugin API key field.  
After that, click **"Activate"** in WordPress plugin.

**Congratulations** - Patchstack is now up and running on your site!  
If you want to have your site protected by our vPatches and firewall, you can click on **Activate for $5 on the App** button. You will be directed to set up billing to enable the Patchstack protection.
