## Getting started guide

**Welcome to Patchstack!**\
Patchstack is a powerful tool that helps to protect your WordPress applications from attacks and identify security vulnerabilities within all your WordPress plugins, themes, and core.
It is powered by the WordPress ecosystem’s most active community of ethical hackers.

This guide will walk you through the whole product, showing you how to set up Patchstack on your site and make the most of it in the future.

[Check the more detailed tutorial here](/getting-started/adding-your-first-site)

### Step #3 — Review vulnerabilities

Patchstack shows your site for existing plugin & theme vulnerabilities. After that, check your dashboard to see a detailed breakdown of vulnerabilities by patch prioriy and severiy score.

Take immediate action on the **High Priority** vulnerabilities.

### Step 4# — Enable real-time protection

Hackers only need a few hours to exploit a known vulnerability — before the plugin developers can issue an update. Enable real-time protection with vPatching to protect your site(s) for $5 / month per site.

vPatching doesn’t modify your website code. It’s 100% safe and works as a targeted security rule to block the exploit of specific vulnerabilities.

Enable real-time-protection - just toggle the **Protection** switch in the sites list and go process the payment.

### Step #5 — Check your software for updates

Check the status of your plugins and themes. Apply the necessary updates, and decide whether you’d like to: 
1. Auto-update only vulnerable software; or
2. Auto-update all software (plugins, themes and/or WordPress core versions)

### Step #6 — Enable protection modules

With real-time protection enabled, select which protection modules you’d like to use to protect your site. From vPatching to Community IP blocklist, Patchstack blocks exploits with highly-targeted security rules.
