Our whitelist feature makes it easy to whitelist specific requests.

To whitelist:

<ol><li>Log in to the Patchstack App</li>
<li>Go to <b>Sites</b> > <b>yourdomain.com</b> > <b>Hardening</b></li>
<li>Scroll down to <b>Whitelist text field</b></li>
</ol>

This text field supports a specific syntax that you can use to whitelist specific requests. Each definition must be placed on its own line.

We accept the following parameters in this text field:

**Parameters**  
IP:IPADDRESS  
PAYLOAD:someval  
URL:/someurl

**Definitions**  
IP = firewall will not run against the IP  
PAYLOAD = if the entire payload contains the keyword, the firewall will not proceed  
URL = if the URL contains the given URL, the firewall will not proceed

**Example**  
IP:192.168.1.1  
PAYLOAD:contact_form  
URL:water  
URL:/some-form

In this scenario, the firewall will not run if the IP address is 192.168.1.1 or if the payload contains contact_form or if the URL contains water, or if the URL contains /some-form.
