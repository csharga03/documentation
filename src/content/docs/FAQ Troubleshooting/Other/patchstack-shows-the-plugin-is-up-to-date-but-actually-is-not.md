This can happen with the premium or pro-licensed plugins, that use different updating mechanisms compared to normal plugins.

The information we show about the plugin status in Patchstack App, is synced straight from the WordPress site itself. 
If the plugin in Patchstack App shows **Up to date**, but in reality it is not, then it simply means that the plugin uses some sort of custom version handling mechanism and these plugin versions active on your site cannot be properly compared with the newest version number in the plugin vendor server.
