This can happen with the premium or pro-licensed plugins, that use different updating mechanisms compared to normal plugins.

The information we show about the plugin status in Patchstack App, is synced straight from your WordPress site.

If the plugin in Patchstack App shows **Up to date**, but in reality it isn't - then it simply means that this plugin uses some sort of custom version handling mechanism. The plugin version active on your site cannot be properly compared with the newest version number in the plugin vendor server.
