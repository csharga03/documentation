Rather than wait for your software to become infected we focus on preemptive measures. This allows Patchstack to be up to 10x lighter than competing (often bloated) malware scanners and still provide effective security.
Plugin-level malware scanners can easily be whitelisted by malware itself, therefore scanning with plugin-level scanner could leave a false impression of site being clean.

We recommend scanning your site with network-level tools like Imunify360 or ClamAV.
