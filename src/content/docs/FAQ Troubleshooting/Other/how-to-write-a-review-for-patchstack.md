Reviews are a good source for people who are considering trying out Patchstack. When you write a review try to explain your experience, the features you like the most, and how they helped you.

This will help us and we really appreciate your help in showing the value we create. 

<b>We collect reviews on two different platforms:</b>

<b>WordPress.org:</b> <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/patchstack/reviews/" target="_blank">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/patchstack/reviews/</a>

<b>G2:</b> <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/patchstack/reviews" target="_blank">https://www.g2.com/products/patchstack/reviews</a>

When writing a review, remember that youâ€™re reviewing a service that our team poured our heart and soul into to create.  

When you have problems with the service, it's always good to <b><a href="#" id="launch-intercom">open up a  support chat</a> to find help from our team first.</b> Our minimum response time is between a few minutes to a few hours. 


<script>document.querySelector("#launch-intercom").addEventListener("click", ()=>{Intercom("show")});</script>
