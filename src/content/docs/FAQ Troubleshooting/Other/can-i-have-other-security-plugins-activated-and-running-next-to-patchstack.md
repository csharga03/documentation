It is possible to run other security plugins next to Patchstack to extend the security features present on your site.

Do note that we cannot guarantee that your site will function properly and smoothly with multiple security plugins installed and activated. Definitely do not enable 2 of the same features, such as login 2FA or login page rename on 2 or more security plugins.

Finally, one thing to keep in mind is that the performance of your site will go down with multiple security plugins installed.
