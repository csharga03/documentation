There are many reasons why this can happen, usually, it's because of an .htaccess issue or because the Patchstack plugin does not work properly with one of your other plugins.

First, please copy and paste the PHP error that you are facing and send it to us <a href="#" id="launch-intercom">through our chatbox</a> at the bottom right corner of the page. This will help us to resolve your issue.

Secondly, if you can still access your WordPress admin panel, go to **Plugins**, find **Patchstack Security** and click on **Deactivate**. After that, if your site still shows the fatal error, go back to **Plugins** and click **Delete** under **Patchstack Security**.

If you cannot access your WordPress admin area at all, we recommend deleting the plugin manually. For that, follow the instructions [here](/faq-troubleshooting/plugin/how-to-delete-the-patchstack-plugin-manually/).

Possible fatal errors:  
"Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class Patchstack in…"


<script>document.querySelector("#launch-intercom").addEventListener("click", ()=>{Intercom("show")});</script>
