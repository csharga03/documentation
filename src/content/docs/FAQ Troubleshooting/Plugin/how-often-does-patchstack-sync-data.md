Patchstack syncs with your site on different intervals for different purposes.
Here's a list of how often and for what we sync.

**Logs** are synced every 15 minutes (activity and protection logs)
**Firewall rules** (vPatching and Community IP blocklist) are synced every hour
**Software data** is synced twice a day at random times. Also the software data is synced every time when you update, activate, deactivate, delete any plugin/theme in your WordPress admin
**Ping** your site is pinged by Patchstack every 3 hours to check if it is still properly connected to the Patchstack App
