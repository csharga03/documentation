Since version 1.3.5, we moved the Patchstack settings page to its own page.

**Versions 1.3.5 up to 2.1.0**  
When we released version 1.3.5 of the Patchstack plugin, we moved the Patchstack settings page link from its own section to the "Settings" menu of WordPress. It can now be found under the "Security" sub-menu option of the "Settings" main menu.

**Versions 2.1.0+**  
Since version 2.1.0, the Patchstack settings are hidden by default and we encourage you to manage the Patchstack settings of your WordPress site through <https://app.patchstack.com>. If you do not wish to do this, you can go to **/wp-admin** > **Settings** > **Security**, and on this page click on the link at the bottom of the screen to turn on the setting management through WordPress.


**Upcoming version 2.2.13+**
Settings management from the plugin is removed.
