From the **Reports** page, you can generate PDF security reports for your sites.  
With Patchstack, you can automatically schedule your reports generation so you don't have to manually generate them.

Patchstack has 2 different types of reports available:

- **[Snapshot report](/patchstack-app/reports/snapshot-report/)**  
  This is a security report about the current situation on the website. Snapshot report is a free feature for all user plans.
- **[Developer report](/patchstack-app/reports/developer-report/)**  
  This is a periodic security report about the situation on the website, with security suggestions and improvements. Developer report generation is available for the Developer and Business plan users only. Developer reports can be scheduled to be auto-generated monthly, or weekly.

On the **Reports** page you can view and download all the previously generated PDF reports.  
To download a report, click on the download icon that is located at the right side of the table.

To view and manage your scheduled reports, click on **Scheduled reports** tab. Note that scheduling is for paid plans only (Developer and Business plans).
