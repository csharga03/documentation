- **[Developer report](/patchstack-app/reports/developer-report/)**  
  This is a periodic security report about the situation on the website, with security suggestions and improvements. Developer report is for the Developer and Business plan users only.

From the **Reports** page you can see all the generated reports.  
To download a report, click on the download icon that is located on the right side of the table.
