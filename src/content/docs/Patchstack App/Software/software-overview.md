_Software overview is accessible for the Community, Developer and Business plan users._  

Navigate to the software overview page by clicking **Software** from the navigation menu, or click here: 
[https://app.patchstack.com/software/overview](https://app.patchstack.com/software/overview)

On the **Software** overview page, you can see the general overview, that shows all the components (plugins, themes, WordPress core, PHP and MySQL versions) that each of your sites use.  
The table on this page shows, which of the components are vulnerable and which ones have updates available.
Plugins and themes that are grayed, are currently deactivated on the website.

## Updating the software

You can update your software on that page. Keep in mind to backup your files and databases before doing that.  
If you wish to update components individually, you can select those one by one by clicking on the checkbox on the left column. After that, click on **Action** > **Update**.  
Your software versions should start updating on your WordPress sites immediately.
