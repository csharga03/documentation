_Software logs are acessible for the Community, Developer and Business plan users._  

Navigate to the software logs page by visiting **Software** > **Logs**, or click here: 
<https://app.patchstack.com/software/logs>

On the **Logs** subpage you can see the history of what actions have you taken with different software (themes, plugins and WordPress core) through the Patchstack App.

As seen on the screenshot below, it shows that the user has updated three plugins on three different websites.
