On the **Automatic updates** subpage, you can see which of your sites have auto-updates enabled. You can turn automatic updates for each of your sites on / off.  
Patchstack also has an option to only auto-update such software that has any vulnerabilities detected.

**Automatic updates** feature is available since version 2.0.11. So, if there is no possibility of turning auto-updates on, make sure you have the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/patchstack/" target="_blank">latest version of Patchstack</a> installed on your site.

For each site, you have the following options:

<ol><li>Auto-update only vulnerable components (recommended)</li>
<li>Auto-update WordPress core</li>
<li>Auto-update plugins</li>
<li>Auto-update themes</li>
</ol>

To activate any of the options, toggle the buttons.

> ❗️ Keep in mind that updating software could potentially break your site, but for security reasons, it is recommended to auto-update at least your vulnerable components.

After toggling the buttons, click **Update**.
