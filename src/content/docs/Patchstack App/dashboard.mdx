To access the main dashboard in Patchstack App, click on **Dashboard** from the left-side navigation menu.

**Dashboard** shows you a general overview of all your WordPress sites:

## Vulnerabilities section

![](@images/patchstack-dashboard-vulnerabilities-section.png)

Vulnerabilities section shows you a general overview about all the vulnerabilities currently present on each of your WordPress sites. The vulnerabilities are divided into three different groups, which indicate the patching priority:

<Steps>
1. **High patch priority** software versions are expected to be mass-exploited or have already known to be exploited vulnerabilities. It's important to patch those by updating the software to patched versions and/or enabling Patchstack firewall, which applies vPatches automatically.

2. **Medium patch priority** software versions are not expected to be mass-exploited, but could potentially be exploited in more targeted attacks. It's important to patch those by updating the software to patched versions and/or enabling Patchstack firewall, which applies vPatches automatically.

3. **Low patch priority** software versions are not expected to be exploited, therefore low patch priority vulnerabilities won't receive a vPatch from Patchstack.
</Steps>


## Vulnerability information and filtering

You can use the search bar on the dashboard page, to find current vulnerabilities across any of your specific sites, or you can search your vulnerabilities by description.

There are three main filters for vulnerability searching on the dashboard:
<Steps>
1. **Priority filter** - find vulnerabilities by patch priority. You can filter by high, medium and low patch priority vulnerabilities.

2. **Severity filter** - find vulnerabilities by <a href="/faq-troubleshooting/other/what-is-the-cvss-score/" target="_blank">CVSS severity score</a>. You can filter by critical, high, medium, low severity.

3. **Exploited** - filter out the vulnerabilities that are know to be exploited.
</Steps>


### List of vulnerability icons with descriptions

  <div>

  **High patch priority**  
  Red exclamation mark indicates that this software version is expected to be mass-exploited or has already known to be exploited vulnerability. It is recommended to turn on Patchstack firewall as high patch priority vulnerabilities receive a vPatch from Patchstack. Update this software as soon as possible.

  <div>

  **Medium patch priority**  
  Yellow exclamation mark indicates that this software version is not expected to become mass-exploited, but could potentially be exploited in more targeted attacks. It is recommended to turn on Patchstack firewall as medium patch priority vulnerabilities receive a vPatch from Patchstack. Update this software as soon as possible.

  **Low patch priority**  
  Gray exclamation mark indicates that this software version is not expected to become exploited. It is important to update this software when possible, although the security risk is very low. Low patch priority vulnerabilities won't receive a vPatch from Patchstack.

  **CVSS score**  
  These numbers represent the CVSS score given to the vulnerability. The higher the CVSS score, the more severe is the vulnerability.

It also shows how many of your sites have any outdated or vulnerable components.  
To add new websites to Patchstack App, click the **"+ Add new"** button. It will trigger a popup with steps to take to add more websites.

## Software

In the **Software** section, you can see how many software components (plugins, themes, WordPress core) your sites have in total.  
The next number shows how many of these are vulnerable.  
The third number shows how many of these components are disabled.

## Reports

In the **Reports** section, you can see how many reports have been scheduled and how many are available to download.
