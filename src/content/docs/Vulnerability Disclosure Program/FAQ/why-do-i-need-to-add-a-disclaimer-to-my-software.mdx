To be listed in our VDP platform, a disclaimer is required in your readme.md or security.txt file of your software.
This disclaimer: 

- Shows that you as a plugin owner or company take security seriously
- Gives researchers a way to post their vulnerability findings to Patchstack directly and in correct format
- Gives a level of certainty to researchers that the data will be sent to correct place
