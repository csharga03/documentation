Patchstack mVDP platform uses an authentication method, which lets you log in by using so called "magic login link".
Once you have entered your account email address, you'll receive a login link to your email.
You will be automatically signed in by clicking this link.

Magic login link expires in 30 minutes. After that, you will need to request another login link.
